Jane Doe: Welcome everyone to today's session on unit testing.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Jane Doe: Let's start by discussing why testing is important.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
John Smith: Could you explain the difference between unit tests and integration tests?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Jane Doe: Great question. Unit tests focus on individual components in isolation.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Alice Johnson: Are there any specific frameworks you recommend for Go?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
